🌿 Plant Disease Identification using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based solution for identifying plant diseases from leaf images. It leverages image processing and classification techniques to assist farmers and agriculturists in diagnosing diseases early, enabling timely treatment and improved crop health.

🧠 Model Highlights

📷 Input: Leaf images of various plants

🏷️ Output: Predicted disease label or "Healthy"

🔍 Uses image classification to detect patterns and symptoms

🎯 High accuracy achieved using CNN-based architecture

💾 Pre-trained model saved for easy deployment or integration

✨ Features

Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)

Trained on labeled plant disease datasets (e.g., PlantVillage)

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Visual output of prediction with image preview (if applicable)

Ready for integration into a web or mobile app

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (model building)
